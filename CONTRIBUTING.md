## Coding conventions

### Git Commit Guidelines

We follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for git commit message formatting. These rules make it easier to review commit logs and improve contextual understanding of code changes. This also allows us to auto-generate the CHANGELOG from commit messages.
